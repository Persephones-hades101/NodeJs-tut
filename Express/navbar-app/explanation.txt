When the browser receives this HTML file, it parses it and notices the references to styles.css and browser-app.js in the <link> and <script> tags. When the browser encounters these references, it will send additional HTTP requests to the server to fetch these resources. These requests will have URLs like /styles.css and /browser-app.js.

Here's what happens when you access '/':

The server responds with index.html.
The browser parses index.html and encounters the <link> and <script> tags for styles.css and browser-app.js.
The browser sends additional HTTP requests to the server for /styles.css and /browser-app.js.
The server, based on the logic in your code, responds to these requests by serving the corresponding CSS and JavaScript files.
So, when you access the root URL '/', the browser fetches and applies the styles from styles.css and executes the JavaScript code from browser-app.js as specified in the HTML file. This is how the styles and functionality from styles.css and browser-app.js affect the appearance and behavior of the web page loaded from '/'.
